                  Actinic keratosis (AK) is the most common precancer that forms on skin damaged by chronic exposure

                  AK sometimes disappears on its own but might return after more sun exposure. Only about 10% of AK will eventually
                  become cancerous. Unfortunately, there's no way to tell which AKs will become dangerous, so monitoring 
                  and treating any that crop up is the only way to be sure. Left untreated, the risk of AK turning into skin cancer 
                  is 5-10%.

                <p class="card-text">
                  A specific type of nevus (mole) that looks different from a common mole. 
                  Dysplastic nevi are mostly flat and often larger than common moles and have borders that are irregular.
                  A dysplastic nevus can contain different colors, which can range from pink to dark brown.

                  A dysplastic nevus may occur anywhere on the body, but it is usually seen in areas exposed 
                  to the sun, such as on the back. A dysplastic nevus may also appear in areas not exposed to the sun,
                   such as the breasts and areas below the waist

                  Parts of the mole may be raised above the skin surface. A dysplastic nevus may develop into melanoma 
                  (a type of skin cancer), and the more dysplastic nevi a person has, the higher the risk of melanoma.

                  A dysplastic nevus can have a mixture of several colors, from pink to dark brown. It is usually flat, 
                  with a smooth, slightly scaly, or pebbly surface, and it has an irregular edge that may fade into the

                  Vascular lesions are relatively common abnormalities of the skin and underlying tissues, 
                  more commonly known as birthmarks. There are three major categories of vascular lesions: 
                  Hemangiomas, Vascular Malformations, and Pyogenic Granulomas. While these birthmarks can 
                  look similar at times, they each vary in terms of origin and necessary treatment.

                  They’re the result of blood vessel growth underneath the surface of the skin, and they 
                  usually appear shortly after birth. Lesions may appear in a number of forms: wounds, 
                  sores, ulcers, and tumors.

                  in certain areas of your body, and this can result in a number of medical complications.

                  Treatments for vascular malformations focus on minimizing symptoms and

                  not need treatment and can just be observed over time.<br><br>
                  Treatments depend on the affected blood vessels. They often involve closing off 
                  or surgically removing affected blood vessels. Most malformations can be treated 
                  using minimally invasive techniques.

                  Melanoma is the most serious type of skin cancer, develops in the cells (melanocytes) 
                  that produce melanin - the pigment that gives your skin its color. Melanoma can also

                  Basal cell carcinoma occurs most often on areas of the skin that are exposed to the sun, such as your head and neck.
                  They are caused by long-term exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight. It usually 
                  develops on sun-exposed parts of your body, especially your head and neck. It can also develop
                  on parts of your body usually protected from the sun, such as the genitals.

                  Basal cell carcinoma rarely spread beyond the original tumor site. But these lesions can grow and become disfiguring and dangerous.
                  Untreated cells can become locally invasive, grow wide and deep into the skin and destroy skin, tissue and bone. The longer you
                  wait to get treatment, the more likely it will recur and sometimes repeatedly.

                  Treatments for vascular malformations focus on minimizing symptoms and 
                  reducing potential complications. Malformations that don’t cause problems may 
                  not need treatment and can just be observed over time.<br><br>
                  Treatments depend on the affected blood vessels. They often involve closing off 
                  or surgically removing affected blood vessels. Most malformations can be treated 
                  using minimally invasive techniques.
